# Berlin Marathon 2025
> 2025/09/21

One more Berlin marathon.
One more time, I'm a mere spectator.
This event is very dear to me because this is where I got my inspiration to run.
The runners go right past my house.
I still remember the first time I saw them.
The energy and the vibe were infectious.
I was even more impressed with the crowd cheering the runners.
That's when I decided to start running.
My goal was to run the next Berlin marathon.

It's been 4 years since then. I'm still not there.
But eventually, I will get there.
For now, I'm content being a spectator and cheering for these amazing athletes.
