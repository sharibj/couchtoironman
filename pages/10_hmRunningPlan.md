# Half Marathon Running Plan
> 30/07/26

I use AI (Gemini) to create a running plan for me. It focuses primarily on building endurance and not speed.

> After one of your easy runs, perform 4-6 strides by smoothly accelerating for 20-30 seconds to a fast but relaxed pace, focusing on good form, not all-out sprinting. Walk back to your starting point for a full minute of recovery after each repetition. This will safely improve your running efficiency and leg speed without the stress of a hard workout.
