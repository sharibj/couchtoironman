# My first GYM Membership
> 2025/05/15

I do home workouts. I've a couple of dumbbells, 1 kettlebell, and recently I even bought a foldable bench.

But I've never been to a gym. As I'm writing this, I vaguely recall registering at a gym a very long time ago. Even then I went only a couple of times, had no idea what to do there, and eventually stopped going.

Why did I get a membership now? Mostly because it was free. I'm happy with my home-workouts and don't have high hopes of this gym membership. I just wanted to try it out.

I get 3 months of free access. I intend to use the treadmills and also put what little I've learned about strength training to use.

Eventually, I would like to build muscles, but for now, my main goal remains to build endurance and stamina. I need to work towards my first triathlon and I can't even swim yet.

Still, I look forward to trying out the gym. Maybe I'll get to know a few people in my area who share a similar goal.
