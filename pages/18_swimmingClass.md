# First Swimming Coach

> 2025/10/24

Can I swim?
It's a simple question with a complicated answer.
I actually had to ponder this a little before I decided whether to mark the swimming milestone as done.
I've been learning to swim on my own.
I learned to float by just spending time in the water.
I learned the basics of breaststroke, first by watching other swimmers, then by watching videos online.
I also learned about buoyancy.
This summer I went to the Sommerbad (outdoor swimming pool) a few times and practised swimming.
By the end of summer, I was able to swim the entire breadth of the pool (roughly 25m) without stopping.
I also held my own in the deep pool, not for long, though.
However, I still don't know how to swim properly.

So can I swim?
Technically, yes.
But I don't think I can call myself a swimmer yet.

I decided to get a swimming coach to help me improve my technique.
Today was my first session with her.
(Actually, my second session, but the first one was two months ago and just a trial, so I don't count it.)
She's a triathlete from Ukraine who has been living in Germany for a while and does not speak much English.
Communication is a bit of a challenge, but we manage.

She started with having me do some warm-up exercises on land.
Then she had me do some breathing exercises in the water.
After that, we moved on to some kicking exercises with a kickboard.

Kicking is very difficult for me.
The motion is supposed to come from the hips, but I struggle with that range of motion.
I need to strengthen my hip flexors and adductors to be able to do that properly.
I'll continue my strength training exercises, and I'm sure it'll eventually get better.
But for now, my kicking is weak and inefficient.

Crawling is another challenge.
My left shoulder is injured, and my doctor has prescribed physiotherapy for it.
It'll start next month, and I hope it'll help.
For now, I have to be careful with my shoulder and avoid any movements that cause pain.

But the most difficult part of swimming for me is breathing.
Coordinating the arm movements with breathing is very challenging.
I also tend to breathe shallowly, which means that when I turn my head to breathe, I don't get enough air.
Then sometimes I for to exhale properly and end up holding my breath underwater for too long.

Then there are cramps.
I get terrible cramps in my calves and feet when I swim.

All in all, I think this sport is the worst suited for my physiology.
My body is not built for swimming.
I have no strength, no flexibility, and no rhythm.

But I won't give up.
I kind of like that it seems impossible at the moment.
It'll be a great achievement if I can learn to swim properly.

I plan on doing these sessions once a week.
I'll try to practise on my own once a week as well.
Hopefully, by next summer, I'll be able to swim properly.

For a sprint marathon, I need to be able to swim 750m.
That's 15 lengths of a standard 50m pool.
So I need to go from 0.5 lengths to 15 lengths.
A long way to go, but I'm excited for the journey.
