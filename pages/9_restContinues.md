# Rest Continues
> 2025/07/29

Another month went by without much running.

A friend visited me for 2 weeks so I was busy showing her around.
2 weeks before that I did suffecient strength training at home but not much running.

I need to find a rythm.
With 2 more weeks of vacation coming up soon, it will be even more difficult to make time for running.
Maybe the pressure of the upcoming half marathon will help.

My plan was also to start swimming classes by now but that didn't happen either. I couldn't even capitalise on good weather and use the sommerbad (open pubic swimng pool) to practice.
Need to sort that out too.

I cancelled my gym membership as I was hardly utilising it.
Home workouts and outdoor running work better for me.
I do have a month left so maybe I'll do some speed work on a treadmill.

Hopefully the next post will be about some nice runs or swims.
