# First Swimming Lesson
> 2025/08/21

A friend of mine is learning to swim from a triathlete.
I asked her to get me started as well.
This coach doesn't speak much English, but since there is no binding contract, I decided to give it a try.
Communication wasn't an issue.
I mentioned I couldn't swim, and she started with the basics.
First warmup exercises, then some breathing exercises.
Then some kicking exercises with a kickboard.
All of this in a professional swimming pool. It was crowded too.
I got a cramp very quickly.
Couldn't swim and had to drown to the bottom to stretch my leg.
It's a good thing I had been practising alone in the shallow pool. I would've been terrified otherwise.
I must have done about 10 laps. She kept correcting my form and pushing me to kick my legs more.
In the last lap, I tried to do my best and kicked as hard as I could.
I got a terrible cramp in my calf.
Worst I ever had.
I could see the calf muscle shrinking and knotting up.
I couldn't finish the lap and had to get out.

There's a long way to go.
Sadly, no more classes for another month as she has some prior commitments.
But I intend to start again with this coach in mid-September.
