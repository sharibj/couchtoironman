# 5k Race Day Update
> 2025/06/04

Race day came. I was nowhere near my goal of running a 5k in under 30 minutes, but I was determined to give it my best shot.
I couldn't train the week before the run, so I basically missed 1 interval run and 2 easy runs.
I reached the venue early to warm up and get a feel for the course. The weather was perfect, the crowd was buzzing, and I was ready to go.
The event was a lot bigger than I expected. Multiple companies were participating.
I was the first racer in our relay team.

30 minutes before the race, I started doing my warm-up routine.
It was nothing new. The same stretches and light jog I had done many times before.
However, this time when I bent down for 4-stretch count, I felt a sharp pain in my right lower back. The pain was so sudden and intense that I couldn't stand up straight.
I was having trouble walking and running was out of the question.
I somehow managed to get to my team and told them about the pain.
It was a huge disappointment. I had been looking forward to this.
They had to find a replacement for me.

I tried to go home, but the pain was so bad that I had to ask the organisers for help.
I was taken to the first aid tent where they gave me some painkillers. I had to lie down for 40 minutes before I could stand up straight again.
It was brutal lying there, listening to the cheers and the music and not being able to run. After 40 minutes, I was still in pain, but I could stand up straight.
Somehow I managed to get home.
On the first day I was bedridden and needed assistance even to get out of bed.
It Took a couple of days off work and a lot of muscle relaxants to get back to a stage where I could walk without pain.

It's 5th day since. I still feel a little pain in my lower back, and I can't sit for long, but I can walk.

I don't know what caused the pain. Is it my age? Is it my lack of training? Is it just a coincidence? I'm not sure.

It's been 2 weeks now since my last run, and I'm not sure how many more days I need to recover.

I'll take it easy for a while and focus on my recovery. Then I'll start running again, and this time I'll be even more rigid about my training plan. I took it easy for a week, and it turned into 2 weeks. Now I don't want to stop running unless I have to.

Sub-30 5k will take a while, but I will get there.
