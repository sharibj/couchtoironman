# 5k Training Update
> 2025/05/25

My next 5k is in 1 week. My original goal was to run it under 30 minutes, but so far I haven't been able to improve my pace beyond 07:30/km.
I still have a week to train, but I don't think I'll be able to shave off a minute and a half in that time.

I also realised that it might not be like the usual 5ks, with lots of people running at different paces. It's a company event with only 7 teams. Which means that there will be only 7 people running at the same time, and I'm pretty sure I'll be the slowest.
I now know, thanks to the epic [Breakfast Run failure in Prague](?1_first10k), that being left behind doesn't feel good and throws off my pace and morale. (Although this could be a good opportunity to learn from the experience and not let it affect me this time.)

I haven't been consistent with my running plan, and so far, I'm lagging by 2 runs. I end up doing zone 3–4 runs instead of the prescribed zone 2 easy runs, but I feel I'm barely running if I do zone 2. I neglected my diet and hydration, as a result of which I've gained roughly 2 kgs even with consistent workouts.

Overall, things are not going as planned, but to be honest, I never expected them to.
I'll try my best to run the 5k in under 30 minutes, but I won't be disappointed if I don't. I've been running longer and faster than ever since my injury. I was even able to inspire my wife to start running. I'll count that as a win.

I need to work on my endurance and easy runs to build a better base before I can start focusing on speed. For the upcoming 5k, 35–40 minutes seems more realistic than 30 minutes.
