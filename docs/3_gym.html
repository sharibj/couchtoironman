<p>I do home workouts. I have a couple of dumbbells, one kettlebell, and recently, I even bought a foldable bench.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ve never been to a gym. As I write this, I vaguely recall registering at a gym long ago. Even then, I went only a few times, had no idea what to do there, and eventually stopped.</p>
<p>Why did I get a membership now? Mainly because it was free. I&#39;m happy with my home-workouts and don&#39;t have high hopes of this gym membership. I just wanted to try it out.</p>

<p>I get 3 months of free access. I intend to use the treadmills and use what little I&#39;ve learned about strength training.</p>
<p>Eventually, I would like to build muscles, but for now, my main goal remains to build endurance and stamina. I need to work towards my first triathlon, and I can&#39;t even swim yet.</p>
<p>Still, I look forward to trying out the gym. Maybe I&#39;ll get to know a few people in my area who share a similar goal.</p>
