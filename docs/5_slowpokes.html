<p>I had posted on Strava that I was looking for someone or some group to run with. The criterion was, of course, that they matched my pace, which at the moment is relatively slow (around 8 min/km)</p>
<p>Someone recommended the Slowpokes club. They did almost 5 km every Monday evening at a comfortable (still slightly faster than mine) pace. I decided to join them.</p>
<p>This Monday, I finally went there directly from work. Which meant I was still carrying my laptop bag. I also had 3 cups of coffee and no water for almost the entire day, so I was parched by the time I reached.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a nice run. I was working hard but not too hard, and the trainer was friendly and encouraging. She also had us do some warm-up and cooldown stretches, which I had been neglecting.</p>
<p>The group consisted of around seven people, mostly women. I was the slowest, but I didn&#39;t mind. My bag opened twice during the run, so I had to stop, fix it, and catch up with the group. In the end, I just carried it in front of me and held it with one hand.</p>
<p>I think I can keep going at least until my pace improves considerably. Next week, they are doing a 10k, which I&#39;ll skip, but the next time they do a short run, I&#39;ll join them again.</p>
<p>I also explored some other clubs in the area, but I need a considerably faster pace for most of them. I think I&#39;ll stick with Slowpokes for now.</p>
