<p>Another month went by without much running.</p>
<p>I did some runs in the first week and did sufficient strength training at home during the 2nd week.
A friend stayed with me for the last 2 weeks of the month so I was busy showing her around and didn&#39;t work out at all.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/restcontinues.png" alt="Runs in July"></p>
<p>I need to find a rhythm.
With two more weeks of vacation coming up soon, it will be even more difficult to make time for running.
Maybe the pressure of the upcoming half-marathon will help.</p>
<p>My plan was also to start swimming classes by now but that didn&#39;t happen either. I couldn&#39;t even capitalise on good weather and use the sommerbad (open pubic swimng pool) to practice.
Need to sort that out too.</p>
<p>I cancelled my gym membership as I was hardly utilising it.
Home workouts and outdoor running work better for me.
I do have a month left, so maybe I&#39;ll do some speed work on a treadmill.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the next post will be about some nice runs or swims.</p>
