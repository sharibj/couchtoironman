<p>I&#39;m training for my 5k, which is in 3 weeks.</p>
<p>My goal is to run it in under 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I used the Runnna app to get a training plan. I&#39;ve committed to 3 runs per week, but this time I want to do different kinds of runs.</p>
<p>My very first run was an interval run. I had done run-walk-repeat before, but I didn&#39;t know that an interval run is supposed to be high pace and intensity. This time, I intended to do a proper interval run.</p>
<p>The app asked for a 1.6km easy run, 6x 400m fast + 60s walking, and a 1.4km slow run.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/intervalPace.png" alt="pace"></p>
<p>I did the easy run at an average 8:15 pace and the intervals at an average 6:00 pace. I ran as fast as 5:30, which I hadn&#39;t done before unless I was sprinting.</p>
<p>Only in the end, I couldn&#39;t do the continuous slow run and had to walk the last 500m.</p>
<p>I was spent.</p>

<p>P.S. This run made me a local legend on Strava. I&#39;m not sure what to do with this make-believe crown.</p>
