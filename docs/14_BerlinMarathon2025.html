<p>One more Berlin marathon.
One more time I&#39;m a mere spectator.
This event is very dear to me because this is where I got my inspiration to run.
The runners go right past my house.
I still remember the first time I saw them.
The energy and the vibe was infectious.
I was even more impressed with the crows cheering the runners.
That&#39;s when I decided to start running.
My goal was to run the next Berlin marathon.

It&#39;s been 4 years since then. I&#39;m still not there.
But eventually, I will get there.
For now, I&#39;m content being a spectator and cheer for these amazing athletes.</p>
