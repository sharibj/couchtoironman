<p>I had my first treadmill run today.
The app plan had an 8k long run with an increasing pace every 2km.
Since I wanted to try the treadmill, I decided to go to the gym.</p>
<p>The day before I went on an easy run with my wife to give her company. We did a 3k with 10:18 pace. I assumed it would be like a warm-up for me, but I&#39;m not so sure now.
In the morning I did home workout with my online personal trainer. We did legs. My daughter joined me too, so it was fun, but I went all out. It was also the first time my - soon to be 4 - daughter did a full workout with me.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my legs were sore, and I had to muster all my willpower to get to the gym. I reached there around 8pm. Did some stretches and started running.</p>
<p>It felt weird at first. I&#39;m so used to running outside that without the visual cue of things passing by, I couldn&#39;t judge my pace. Next time I&#39;ll try the scenic mode of the treadmill.</p>
<p>Although it was more accurate because I was able to simply program the exact pace I wanted to run at. Starting slow and then increasing the pace is hard because after 4km I was already tired. I had to push myself a lot, especially for the last 1 km. The music helped.</p>

<p>I also did the run in my gym shoes instead of my usual running shoes, but it wasn&#39;t a problem. They were comfy enough.</p>
<p>I was exhausted by the end of the run. I did a cooldown walk and some stretches. I was drenched in sweat, but I felt good.</p>
<p>My plan has a 5k easy run tomorrow, but I&#39;m not sure if I should do it. My legs are sore and I don&#39;t want to overdo it.</p>
