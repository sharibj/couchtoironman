<p>The app plan had an 8 km long run with an increasing pace every 2km.
Since I wanted to try the treadmill, I decided to go to the gym.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I did an easy run with my wife to keep her company. We completed 3k at a 10:18 pace (3 min run, 1 min walk). I assumed it would be more like a warm-up for me, but I&#39;m not so sure now.</p>
<p>This morning, I did a home workout with my online personal trainer. It was leg day. My daughter joined me, too, so it was fun, but I went all out. It was also the first time my soon-to-be-four-year-old daughter did a full workout with me.</p>
<p>My legs were sore, and I had to muster all my willpower to get to the gym. I reached there around 8 p.m. because I wanted to put as much buffer between my workout and my run as possible.</p>
<p>Running on a treadmill felt weird at first. I&#39;m so used to running outside that I couldn&#39;t judge my pace without the visual cue of things passing by. Next time, I&#39;ll try the treadmill&#39;s scenic mode.</p>
<p>It was more accurate because I was able to simply program the exact pace I wanted to run at. Starting slow and then increasing the pace is hard because after 4km, I was already tired. I had to push myself a lot, especially for the last 1 km. The music helped.</p>

<p>I also ran in my gym shoes instead of my usual running shoes, but it wasn&#39;t a problem. They were comfy enough.</p>
<p>I was exhausted by the end of the run. I did a cooldown walk and some stretches. I was drenched in sweat, but I felt good.</p>
<p>My plan is to do a 5k easy run tomorrow, but I&#39;m not sure if I should do it. My legs are sore, and I don&#39;t want to overdo it.</p>
