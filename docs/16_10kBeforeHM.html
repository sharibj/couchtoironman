<blockquote>
<p>2025/10/12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I tell you about my latest 10k, let&#39;s do a quick recap of events before the current week.</p>
<ul>
<li>I could not consistently run 3 times per week as planned.</li>
<li>2 weeks ago, I tried running a 15k but had to stop at 13k.</li>
<li>After that, I had to take a week-long break due to a work trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>That brings us to this week.
On Monday, I joined the Slowpokes Run Club for a 5k run.
They were doing a 7:30 pace, and despite my week-long break, I was confident I could keep up.
I didn&#39;t. I had to stop after 2km.
My confidence was shot.</p>
<p>2 days later, I did a rolling 300 run for 5k. 
I did 300m fast and 300m slow, repeating 6 times, sandwiched by 1k easy runs at the start and end.
I managed to complete this with an average pace of 8:01 min/km.</p>
<p>But I was really doubtful about the 10k that was scheduled for the weekend.
I also didn&#39;t want to push myself too hard just a week before the half-marathon.</p>
<p>So I decided 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would run the 10k at a very easy pace, around 8:30 min/km</li>
<li>I would test out nutrition for the half-marathon by taking gels during the run.</li>
</ol>
<p>After I had a hard time running the 15k, I realised that I might need to manage my nutrition.
It was a hot day, and I had not hydrated well.
So I learned about hydration and nutrition during long runs.
Bought the cheapest gels I could find in Decathlon.
I got 2 pre-run gels and 4 during-run gels.
I decided to test out 2 of those during the 10k, and if all goes well, I will take the rest during the half-marathon.
I also got some electrolyte tablets to mix with water.</p>
<p>On the day of the run, I had a light breakfast two hours before the run: some rice and a protein shake.
I also took a pre-run gel 60 minutes before the run.
I mixed an electrolyte tablet in my 250ml water bottle and took small sips every 2kms.</p>
<p>The weather was perfect for running. It was neither cold nor hot, and the rain was like a light, refreshing mist.
I soon realised that I was running faster than I planned.
I wanted to reel it in, but the atmosphere was so good that I couldn&#39;t.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/great10k.jpeg" alt="Great 10K Berlin"></p>
<p>I finished the 10k, without stopping, in 01:13:54, with an average pace of 7:20 min/km.
It&#39;s not as fast as my fastest 10k or even my first 10k, but it&#39;s the fastest since I resumed running this year.
I was very happy with the result.
But I&#39;m also very anxious now about my half-marathon next week.
Maybe I pushed too hard. Maybe I practised too little.
I have no idea how I&#39;ll perform or if I&#39;ll be able to finish the race.
I guess I&#39;ll find out soon enough.</p>
