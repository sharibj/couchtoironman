<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to put together a glossary of running terms for a while.
<a href="https://support.runna.com/en/articles/9459885-coaching-terms-every-runner-should-know">Runna beat me to it.</a> I&#39;ll copy them here for my reference.</p>
<h2 id="cadence">Cadence</h2>
<p>Cadence refers to the number of steps you take per minute while running. A typical target is around 180 steps per minute, though this varies depending on your height, running speed, and terrain. Everybody is different, so don&#39;t overthink it if your step count looks different. Low cadence can sometimes indicate overstriding, which may increase injury risk. Improving cadence is a common way to refine running technique.</p>
<h2 id="conversational-pace">Conversational Pace</h2>
<p>Used interchangeably with comfortable pace, conversational pace is exactly what it sounds like: a pace at which you can hold a conversation without gasping for breath. This is a key effort level for aerobic development and recovery.</p>
<p>A conversational pace is one that feels easy and sustainable. It shouldn&#39;t leave you out of breath and should allow for a full conversation while running. You&#39;ll often use this pace during warm-ups, recovery runs, and easy runs. It typically aligns with a Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 3–5 out of 10.</p>
<h2 id="cool-down">Cool Down</h2>
<p>A cool down is the easy jog or walk done after a hard session or race. It helps bring your heart rate and breathing down gradually, flush out lactic acid, and reduce muscle soreness. Cool downs play a critical role in recovery and injury prevention.</p>
<h2 id="deload">Deload</h2>
<p>A deload week is a lighter week in your training plan where mileage and intensity are reduced. Typically scheduled every 4–6 weeks, deloads help your body absorb training, reduce accumulated fatigue, and promote consistent progression while lowering injury risk.</p>
<h2 id="easy-run">Easy Run</h2>
<p>An easy run is performed at a slow, relaxed pace with minimal effort—usually around 3–5 RPE. It forms the foundation of most training plans and supports recovery between harder sessions. Top tip: you should be able to chat or listen to a podcast comfortably.</p>
<h2 id="hills-or-hill-repeats">Hills (or Hill Repeats)</h2>
<p>Hill workouts involve running up inclines to build strength, speed, and running economy. By driving uphill, you naturally improve form, cadence, and stride power. These sessions are often short and intense with a jog or walk recovery back downhill.</p>
<h2 id="interval-session">Interval Session</h2>
<p>Interval training consists of short bursts of faster running (reps), followed by recovery periods. These are high-effort workouts designed to improve speed and VO2 max. By working above your comfort zone in intervals, your sustainable pace improves over time.</p>
<h2 id="lactate-threshold">Lactate Threshold</h2>
<p>Your lactate threshold is the fastest pace at which your body can clear lactate (a byproduct of energy production) from your blood. Beyond this threshold, lactic acid builds up, leading to fatigue. Training near this pace helps improve endurance and speed.</p>
<h2 id="lactic-acid">Lactic Acid</h2>
<p>Also called lactate, this is a byproduct your body produces when converting carbs into energy. It builds up when intensity increases, especially above your lactate threshold, and can contribute to muscle soreness and fatigue.</p>
<h2 id="long-run">Long Run</h2>
<p>The long run is a cornerstone of endurance training. It increases aerobic capacity and mental toughness. For most runners, the long run happens once a week and progresses in distance depending on race goals.</p>
<h2 id="recovery-run">Recovery Run</h2>
<p>A recovery run is a short, low-intensity run done after a hard workout. It&#39;s designed to promote blood flow, support active recovery, and help reduce muscle stiffness. Recovery runs feel easy and use the same pacing as an easy run. Make sure you&#39;re maximizing recovery to reap the full benefits of your training.</p>
<h2 id="rpe-rate-of-perceived-exertion">RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)</h2>
<p>Relative Perceived Effort is a subjective scale from 1–10 that measures how hard a run feels. It helps runners tune into their effort level without relying on devices. An RPE of 3–5 is easy/conversational, 6–7 is steady, 8–9 is hard, and 10 is max effort.</p>
<h2 id="steady-pace">Steady Pace</h2>
<p>Steady pace sits between easy pace and tempo pace. It&#39;s purposeful but controlled. Typically 8–10% slower than your marathon race pace, it&#39;s used to build aerobic fitness and stamina. It should feel &quot;comfortably hard&quot;; sustainable for longer efforts without tipping into threshold.</p>
<h2 id="strides">Strides</h2>
<p>Strides are short bursts of faster running (usually 10–20 seconds) done at about 85–90% of max effort. They&#39;re often included after easy runs or in warm-ups before workouts or races. Strides improve neuromuscular coordination, running form, and turnover without adding fatigue.</p>
<h2 id="tapering">Tapering</h2>
<p>Tapering involves reducing your training load in the final weeks before a race. This recovery-focused period helps your body absorb training and show up race-ready. The goal is to reduce fatigue while maintaining fitness. The taper is sometimes associated with anxiety as runners may worry about losing progress, but a carefully planned tapers does just the opposite.</p>
<h2 id="tempo-session">Tempo Session</h2>
<p>A tempo run is done at a controlled but comfortably hard pace, usually around your lactate threshold or what you&#39;d run for an hour-long effort. Tempo sessions improve your ability to hold faster paces for longer. They&#39;re often described as running at a pace where you can speak in short phrases but not hold a full conversation.</p>
<h2 id="threshold-run">Threshold Run</h2>
<p>Threshold training involves running at or just below your lactate threshold to boost endurance and delay fatigue. These sessions typically include intervals or steady efforts at threshold effort, with short recoveries to manage lactate buildup.</p>
<h2 id="time-trial">Time Trial</h2>
<p>A time trial is a solo effort to test your fitness over a specific distance. Unlike a race, there&#39;s no taper or competition, just you and the clock. Time trials help benchmark progress and guide pacing for future sessions or races.</p>
<h2 id="warm-up">Warm Up</h2>
<p>A warm-up is the essential pre-run routine that preps your body for faster running. It includes light jogging, dynamic stretches, and sometimes running drills or strides. Warming up helps activate muscles, improve mobility, and reduce the risk of injury before a hard effort.</p>
