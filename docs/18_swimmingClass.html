<p>Can I swim?
It&#39;s a simple question with a complicated answer.
I actually had to ponder this a little before I decided whether to mark the swimming milestone as done.
I&#39;ve been learning to swim on my own.
I learned to float by just spending time in the water.
I learned the basics of breaststroke, first by watching other swimmers, then by watching videos online.
I also learned about buoyancy.
This summer I went to the Sommerbad (outdoor swimming pool) a few times and practised swimming.
By the end of summer, I was able to swim the entire breadth of the pool (roughly 25m) without stopping.
I also held my own in the deep pool, not for long, though.
However, I still don&#39;t know how to swim properly.</p>
<p>So can I swim?
Technically, yes.
But I don&#39;t think I can call myself a swimmer yet.</p>
<p>I decided to get a swimming coach to help me improve my technique.
Today was my first session with her.
(Actually, my second session, but the first one was two months ago and just a trial, so I don&#39;t count it.)
She&#39;s a triathlete from Ukraine who has been living in Germany for a while and does not speak much English.
Communication is a bit of a challenge, but we manage.</p>
<p>She started with having me do some warm-up exercises on land.
Then she had me do some breathing exercises in the water.
After that, we moved on to some kicking exercises with a kickboard.</p>
<p>Kicking is very difficult for me.
The motion is supposed to come from the hips, but I struggle with that range of motion.
I need to strengthen my hip flexors and adductors to be able to do that properly.
I&#39;ll continue my strength training exercises, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll eventually get better.
But for now, my kicking is weak and inefficient.</p>
<p>Crawling is another challenge.
My left shoulder is injured, and my doctor has prescribed physiotherapy for it.
It&#39;ll start next month, and I hope it&#39;ll help.
For now, I have to be careful with my shoulder and avoid any movements that cause pain.</p>
<p>But the most difficult part of swimming for me is breathing.
Coordinating the arm movements with breathing is very challenging.
I also tend to breathe shallowly, which means that when I turn my head to breathe, I don&#39;t get enough air.
Then sometimes I for to exhale properly and end up holding my breath underwater for too long.</p>
<p>Then there are cramps.
I get terrible cramps in my calves and feet when I swim.</p>
<p>All in all, I think this sport is the worst suited for my physiology.
My body is not built for swimming.
I have no strength, no flexibility, and no rhythm.</p>
<p>But I won&#39;t give up.
I kind of like that it seems impossible at the moment.
It&#39;ll be a great achievement if I can learn to swim properly.</p>
<p>I plan on doing these sessions once a week.
I&#39;ll try to practise on my own once a week as well.
Hopefully, by next summer, I&#39;ll be able to swim properly.</p>
<p>For a sprint marathon, I need to be able to swim 750m.
That&#39;s 15 lengths of a standard 50m pool.
So I need to go from 0.5 lengths to 15 lengths.
A long way to go, but I&#39;m excited for the journey.</p>
