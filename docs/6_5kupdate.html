<p>My next 5k is in 1 week. My original goal was to run it under 30 minutes, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to improve my pace beyond 07:30/km.
I still have a week to train, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to shave off a minute and a half in that time.</p>
<p>I also realised that it might not be like the usual 5ks, with lots of people running at different paces. It&#39;s a company event with only 7 teams. Which means that there will be only 7 people running at the same time, and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll be the slowest.
I now know, thanks to the epic <a href="1_first10k.html">Breakfast Run failure in Prague</a>, that being left behind doesn&#39;t feel good and throws off my pace and morale. (Although this could be a good opportunity to learn from the experience and not let it affect me this time.)</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t been consistent with my running plan, and so far, I&#39;m lagging by 2 runs. I end up doing zone 3–4 runs instead of the prescribed zone 2 easy runs, but I feel I&#39;m barely running if I do zone 2. I neglected my diet and hydration, as a result of which I&#39;ve gained roughly 2 kgs even with consistent workouts.</p>
<p>Overall, things are not going as planned, but to be honest, I never expected them to.
I&#39;ll try my best to run the 5k in under 30 minutes, but I won&#39;t be disappointed if I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve been running longer and faster than ever since my injury. I was even able to inspire my wife to start running. I&#39;ll count that as a win.</p>
<p>I need to work on my endurance and easy runs to build a better base before I can start focusing on speed. For the upcoming 5k, 35–40 minutes seems more realistic than 30 minutes.</p>
