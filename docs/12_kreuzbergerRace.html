<p>I ran the Kreuzberger
Viertelmarathon (10.5K) today.
I couldn&#39;t stick to my running plan.
New job came with new schedule and I couldn&#39;t find time to run during the weeks.
Once I find a rhythm, I should be able to stick to the plan better.</p>
<p>Still, I hoped to do a lot better.
I participated with my wife and tried to stick to her pace.
This meant I was running very slow. I should&#39;ve been running in zone 2.
But I noticed it was between zone 3 and zone 4.</p>

<p>It was easier for me to finish the race at this pace, but it wasn&#39;t an &quot;easy&quot; run by any means.
This makes me worry.
My half-marathon is nearing and I have a lot to catch up on.</p>
<p>I finished the Viertelmarathon in 1:35:14 (09:04/km) and was dead last.</p>
